# Leetcode++

**<div align="center" >This is a work in progress project</div>**

The main goal of this project is to give the free version of Leetcode a code editor with autocomplete. Leetcode uses the Monaco code editor which has autocomplete by default; however, this feature is disabled in the free version of leetcode. this extension will just update the code editor to enable autocomplete.


TO-DO:

- [x] Enable basic autocomplete
- [ ] Add language servers
